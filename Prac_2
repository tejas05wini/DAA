#Implement job sequencing with deadlines using a greedy method.

# Job Sequencing with Deadlines using Greedy Method

# Number of jobs
n = int(input("Enter number of jobs: "))

jobs = []

print("\nEnter JobID Deadline Profit for each job:")
for i in range(n):
    job_id = input(f"Job {i+1} ID: ")
    deadline = int(input("Deadline: "))
    profit = int(input("Profit: "))
    print()
    jobs.append((job_id, deadline, profit))

# Step 1: Sort by profit (descending)
jobs.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)

# Max deadline will decide slot size
max_deadline = max(job[1] for job in jobs)

# Create time slots
slots = [None] * (max_deadline + 1)

total_profit = 0

# Step 2: Greedy scheduling
for job in jobs:
    job_id, deadline, profit = job

    # Place job in latest free slot
    for t in range(deadline, 0, -1):
        if slots[t] is None:
            slots[t] = job_id
            total_profit += profit
            break

# Output result
print("Scheduled Job Order:", [j for j in slots if j is not None])
print("Total Profit:", total_profit)
